# Improved Web of Things unifies diverse IoT systems [DRAFT]
** THIS IS A DRAFT. The WoT deliverables cited below are still in Proposed Recommendation status.**

https://www.w3.org/ — DD MM 2023 — The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced today that 
[Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/),
[Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/), 
and 
[Web of Things (WoT) Discovery](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/)
are now official W3C Recommendations.
Without breaking compatibility with the [first release in 2020](https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2020/wot-rec/),
these new W3C Recommendations improve and expand the scope of the Web of Things,
and add significant new functionality.
In addition, two supporting W3C Notes have been updated, the
[Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-binding-templates/) 
and the
[Web of Things (WoT) Scripting API](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-scripting-api/).

<!-- Why is it important? -->
## WoT addresses the IoT fragmentation problem
Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) systems suffer from lack of interoperability and fragmentation.
Customers want to be able to choose devices from multiple vendors without redesign.
The Web of Things (WoT) extends the IoT with Web technology to address this issue.
In particular, the WoT recommendations provide a format for standardized descriptive information, 
the WoT Thing Description, to allow easy integration of IoT devices and services.
This includes IoT systems that have already been released and use different IoT 
communication protocols and data standards.
In short, the WoT uses web technology to harmonize access to diverse
IoT devices and breaks silo walls.
This allows WoT applications to be written on top of a single, portable interaction abstraction.

<!-- What is new? -->
## Significant improvements and functionality
These new Recommendations were revised to improve the usability of
the previous release and address new use cases. Significant new features were also defined,
including Thing Models and Discovery.

Thing Models provide a way to describe classes of things, such as product lines from particular vendors, and support modularity by allowing a parameterized model to be built from reusable components. A Thing Model can be used to generate a Thing Description by providing the appropriate parameters.

Discovery provides easy access to Thing Descriptions, while controlling access appropriately to preserve privacy. It does not replace other existing discovery mechanisms but builds upon and applies them to the distribution of Thing Descriptions, which can be done both within a local-area network (LAN) and at scale across the entire Internet. It can also be used for self-describing IoT devices and externally described devices.
A searchable Thing Description Directory service is defined, which makes it an asset in supporting semantic search.

<!-- What is the impact? -->
## Widely adopted and supported
Many [software packages and open-source projects now support WoT](https://www.w3.org/WoT/developers/), including
tools for Thing Description validation and construction as well as support for Thing runtimes and 
Thing Description directories supporting discovery.

Market adoption of the Web of Things is rapidly growing.
The Web of Things has been adopted or is under consideration for adoption by
several standards organizations, including 
[ECHONET](https://echonet.jp/english/), 
[Conexxus](https://www.conexxus.org/),
the [OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org/) (OPC UA Web-of-Things Connectivity WG), 
and the [IPA Digital Architecture Design Center](https://www.ipa.go.jp/en/about/org/dadc/index.html).

The growing WoT user community is supported by multiple [WoT Community Groups](https://www.w3.org/WoT/cg/), 
which hold regular meetings to share information on WoT and its applications in both English and Japanese.
